Missing tests for InputProcessor:
* [x] with invalid ranges (and make sure values are properly quoted) (was in fact broken)
* [x] with invalid value (failed transformation) (was in fact broken for comparisons (wrong path))
* [x] values merging/counting with alias-field
* [x] root-group logical OR (was missing for FilterQuery)

All this refactoring decreased the scrutinizer score, I need to look into making these parts better again.
But on the positive side, some code was actually improved :+1:

I cleaned the commits up to be more precise and not contain unrelated changes.
