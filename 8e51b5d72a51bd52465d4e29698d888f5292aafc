IMO once you merge this, you should consider tagging to see what happens (with the mono-repo and all).

The splitting of commits is not automated yet 😛 I will try to contact Fabien if he can set this up for RollerworksSearch 👍

Don't know what exactly he does to set it up, but the `splitsh-lite` tool was made available for your own use, you can do it on your own if he doesn't have time to do it.

I took the [scripts](https://github.com/dkarlovi/dockerfile-dev/tree/master/bin) from enqueue-dev.

I tagged the sub-splits manually for now. I am working on a more permanent solution 👍

Good news [HubKit](https://github.com/park-manager/hubkit) now allows to split a monolith repository while merging, and... can synchronize a release for all split repositories! So finally no more outdated releases 🎉

I am continuing work on RollerworksSearch 👍
