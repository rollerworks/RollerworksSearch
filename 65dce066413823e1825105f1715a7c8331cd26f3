/cc @dkarlovi can you check if this fixes your issue #199 ?

It should, it's tricky to test as this is now in a branch on a 3rd party repo so I'd need to fetch your fork's branch and push to my fork, etc.

You can test it yourself, just add

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/sstok/search"
        }
    ],
```
on top of your `composer.json`, `require rollerworks/search-dev:dev-root-composer-name`and see if you're getting your fork installed instead of the main repo.

I can merge it, and register it at composer if that's easier ðŸ˜ƒ

~~Register it on Packagist, I'll test it before you merge.~~

Oh yeah, you can't register it before you merge because the name differs in different branches. :see_no_evil:  You're probably going to need to rename the repo on Github too.
