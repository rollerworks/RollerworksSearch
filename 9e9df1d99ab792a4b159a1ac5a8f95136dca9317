BTW would need to define a `.php_cs` file here, any suggestions? The better the config, the better the output. :+1:

I will re-add the .php_cs config file (and some other files) that got lost in the merge process.

A basic .editorconfig in root might be a good idea, for files not covered by CS Fixer.

I'll continue on this, probably later today.

Thanks, I'll rebase.

OK, there we go. You can run make and should get the whole thing running.

It will require quite a bit of fixes as PHPStan finds 660 errors. :sob: But that's another PR.

Can also significantly simplify Travis config (no need for installing `phpcov`, `phpstan`, `php-cs-fixer` as the QA image ships with them), can probably move replace most of it just to run `make ci`.
