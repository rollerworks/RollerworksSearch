@sstok can we talk about this one? What do you feel is required to get this merged?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm adding tests etc, so don't merge if you were going to. :+1:

BTW sorry I keep squashing, just realized you might be reading individual commits which makes it awkward. I'll just add WIP commits and squash before merge.

Also, we should try to use the new build process ASAP, fixing CS Fixer and PHPStan issues would allow us to find and fix new ones in new commits.

@sstok if this looks OK to you, I'll rebase and squash so you can merge.

Also, this was my first time using Prophecy (not a fan) so feel free to comment if I missed any important points.

@sstok seeing you're away end of week, could we see this gets merged before then?
