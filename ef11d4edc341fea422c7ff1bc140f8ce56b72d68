@sstok this is also ready. It's a continuation of #255 so you can either merge that one and then this one (the commits should get removed?) or just this one.

Can you rebase this pull request so it's easier to review? I already merged #255

@sstok there we go, should build.

BTW Gitlab has a nifty button to Rebase directly from a MR screen if FF is possible so there you could have done it with a single click. <3
