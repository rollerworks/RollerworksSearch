Sometimes I wonder why this actually works et-all.
It used to work, nothing has really changed, and yet it fails... ðŸ™Œ

OK, I'm done here ðŸ™‚ Nothing on my part I can do to make Travis work again, nothing related has actually changed, it works locally without any issues. And everything so far I tried didn't fix this situation. Eventually I want to switch to GitHub actions, and then you will RUST TRAVIS! RUST I TELL YA! Hauahahhahha ðŸ¤ª
